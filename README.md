## About The Project

**LogRegs** is a Django-based multi-tenant expense tracking application that allows multiple admins to manage their own users and expenses independently. Each admin-user group (tenant) has fully isolated data to ensure privacy and security.

The app provides admins the ability to perform CRUD operations on users and expenses, and users can manage their own expenses. Live charts help visualize expenses for better tracking and analysis.
